# Weather_App
This app provides information of weather of any city. I have used "api-ninjas" for the same.

1. Clone the Repo and run "index.html" on any browser.
2. Make a free account on "api-ninjas" to use their api 
3. Copy your token from there and put it in the javascript file at a specified location there
